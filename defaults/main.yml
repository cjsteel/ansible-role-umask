# defaults file for umask

# Notes
#
# Redhat distributions such as CentOS 7 have two umask settings
# One for "system" users with UID's of 199 or less
# One for "regular" users with UID's greater than 199

# UMASK is the default umask value for pam_umask and is used by
# useradd and newusers to set the mode of the new home directories.
# 022 is the "historical" value in Debian for UMASK
# 027, or even 077, could be considered better for privacy
# There is no One True Answer here : each sysadmin must make up his/her
# mind.

# umask setting for Debian based distributions (all users have same umask?)
umask_default_umask: '077'  # very strict

# umask settings for Redhat based destributions (system and user umask settings differ)
umask_system_users_umask: '{{ umask_default_umask }}'   # default 002
umask_regular_users_umask: '{{ umask_default_umask }}'  # default 022
